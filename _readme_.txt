If you don't have blender on your system, download it from blender.org. .zip recommended.
Tested version is 2.79b. Copy everything to same directory next to payvis.blend and name the folder blender so you have folowing folder structure:
-blender
 -blender.exe
 -blenderpleyer.exe
 -...
-_readme_.txt
-payvis.blend
-payvis_blinds.blend
-...

Setup your blinds and payouts in the blinds.csv and pool.csv
I use Excel, google sheets and/or notepad++ for that.

Start the app with one of the startup cmds:
start.cmd, start-fullscreen.cmd, start_blinds.cmd, start_blinds-fullscreen.cmd
Difference is in the layout.

Usage:
Change layouts by pressing 1, 2 or 3 on your keyboard.
Adjust your Prizepool by pressing arrow keys up/down.
Adjust time by pressing arrow keys left/right.
F1: Enable/disable smoothing. (can infuence time on weak computers)
