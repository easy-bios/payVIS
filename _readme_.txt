First you need to extract blender.7z to same directory.

Setup your blinds and payouts in the blinds.csv and pool.csv
I use Excel, google sheets and/or notepad++ for that.

Start the app with one of the startup cmds:
start.cmd, start-fullscreen.cmd, start_blinds.cmd, start_blinds-fullscreen.cmd
Difference is in the layout.

Usage:
Change layouts by pressing 1, 2 or 3 on your keyboard.
Adjust your Prizepool by pressing arrow keys up/down.
Adjust time by pressing arrow keys left/right.
F1: Enable/disable smoothing. (can infuence time on weak computers)
